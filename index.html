        <h2>A poem for you: A portable paradise</h2>
        <h3> And if I speak of paradise</h3>
        <h3> I speak of a land far away</h3>
        <h3> Where imagination and creativity</h3>
        <h3> Combine together</h3>
        <h3> Where big screens and controllers</h3>
        <h3> Are lying on the ground</h3>
        <h3> And where brand new video games</h3>
        <h3> Are stacked on the shelves</h3>
        <h3> And then when you'd move on</h3>
        <h3> You'd change it altogether</h3>
        <h3> And hear soothing music</h3>
        <h3> Coming from a piano</h3>
        <h3> Where you can feel the marbly keys</h3>
        <h3> Pressing right down</h3>
        <h3> Where guitar strings would play</h3>
        <h3> As if there were no tommorow</h3>
        <h3> And then you'd move on</h3>
        <h3> And smell sweet honey</h3>
        <h3> Drizzling on a pancake</h3>
        <h3> And you'd bite into it</h3>
        <h3> And devour it right away</h3>
        <h3> And then you'd smell a pizza</h3>
        <h3> And choose your toppings</h3>
        <h3> And you'd admire how it tastes</h3>
        <h3> And if I speak of paradise</h3>
        <h3> I speak of a land far away</h3>
        <h3> Where imagination and creativity</h3>
        <h3> Combine together</h3>
